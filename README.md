# TikTakToe_CSharp
Possibility the play tik tak toe in the browser.

## What does it do?

The application opens on port 5010 in http and https a page with a playing field and an information about the game state.

### What technologies did I use?
- For **styling** I used [bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) because it has a nice, basic library to customize your website page.
- As **framework** [ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core?view=aspnetcore-7.0) with its MVC web application was a good decision in case of reliability, speed and its cross platform features.
- To **store to data** of a game I simply make a use of the [.NET IO](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/io/) library to temporarily store its information in a textfile.
